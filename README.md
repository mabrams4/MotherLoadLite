# MotherLoadLite
This is my first full project in unity. It is modeled after one of my favorite childhood games "MotherLoad", with various unique features of my own design. 
All assets were made comepletey from scratch, and all code can be found in the path MotherLoadLite/MotherLoadLite/Assets/Scripts.
